# ExcELIN2

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. Detailed Excitation System Model - ELIN (VATECH).  This model represents an all-static excitation system. A PI voltage controller establishes a desired field current set point for a proportional current controller. The integrator of the PI controller has a follow-up input to match its signal to the present field current.  Power system stabilizer models used in conjunction with this excitation system model: PssELIN2, PssIEEE2B, Pss2B.
