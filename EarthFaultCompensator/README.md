# EarthFaultCompensator

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. A conducting equipment used to represent a connection to ground which is typically used to compensate earth faults..   An earth fault compensator device modeled with a single terminal implies a second terminal solidly connected to ground.  If two terminals are modeled, the ground is not assumed and normal connection rules apply.
