## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `Diagram[number]`: A diagram object is part of a diagram. Default: None  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `DiagramObjectPoints[number]`: A diagram object can have 0 or more points to reflect its layout position, routing (for polylines) or boundary (for polygons). Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `DiagramObjectStyle[number]`: A diagram object has a style associated that provides a reference for the style used in the originating system. Default: None  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `IdentifiedObject[number]`: The diagram objects that are associated with the domain object. Default: None  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `VisibilityLayers[number]`: A diagram object can be part of multiple visibility layers. Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified[string]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `drawingOrder[number]`: The drawing order of this element. The higher the number, the later the element is drawn in sequence. This is used to ensure that elements that overlap are rendered in the correct order. Default: 0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `isPolygon[number]`: Defines whether or not the diagram objects points define the boundaries of a polygon or the routing of a polyline. If this value is true then a receiving application should consider the first and last points to be connected. Default: False  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name[string]`: The name of this item.  - `offsetX[number]`: The offset in the X direction. This is used for defining the offset from centre for rendering an icon (the default is that a single point specifies the centre of the icon).  The offset is in per-unit with 0 indicating there is no offset from the horizontal centre of the icon.  -0.5 indicates it is offset by 50% to the left and 0.5 indicates an offset of 50% to the right. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `offsetY[number]`: The offset in the Y direction. This is used for defining the offset from centre for rendering an icon (the default is that a single point specifies the centre of the icon).  The offset is in per-unit with 0 indicating there is no offset from the vertical centre of the icon.  The offset direction is dependent on the orientation of the diagram, with -0.5 and 0.5 indicating an offset of +/- 50% on the vertical axis. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `rotation[number]`: Sets the angle of rotation of the diagram object.  Zero degrees is pointing to the top of the diagram.  Rotation is clockwise. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type[string]`: NGSI type. It has to be DiagramObject  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
