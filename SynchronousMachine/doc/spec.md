Default: None  - `voltageRegulationRange`: Range of generator voltage regulation (PG in the IEC 60909-0) used for calculation of the impedance correction factor KG defined in IEC 60909-0 This attribute is used to describe the operating voltage of the generating unit. Default: 0.0  - `x0`: Zero sequence reactance of the synchronous machine. Default: 0.0  - `x2`: Negative sequence reactance. Default: 0.0
