Converter configuration data used in power flow. Default: 0.0  - `resistiveLoss`: Converter configuration data used in power flow. Refer to poleLossP. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `switchingLoss`: Switching losses, relative to the base apparent power `baseS`. Refer to poleLossP. Default: 0.0  - `targetPpcc`: Real power injection target in AC grid, at point of common coupling. Default: 0.0  - `targetUdc`: Target value for DC voltage magnitude. Default: 0.0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be ACDCConverter  - `uc`: Converter voltage, the voltage at the AC side of the bridge. Converter state variable, result from power flow. Default: 0.0  - `udc`: Converter voltage at the DC side, also called Ud. Converter state variable, result from power flow. Default: 0.0  - `valveU0`: Valve threshold voltage. Forward voltage drop when the valve is conducting. Used in loss calculations, i.e. the switchLoss depend on numberOfValves * valveU0. Default: 0.0    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
