    Adapted from CIM data models. Standard aggregate load model comprised of static and/or dynamic components.  A static load model represents the sensitivity of the real and reactive power consumed by the load to the amplitude and frequency of the bus voltage. A dynamic load model can used to represent the aggregate response of the motor components of the load.
