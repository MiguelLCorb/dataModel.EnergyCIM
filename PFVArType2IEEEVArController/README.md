# PFVArType2IEEEVArController

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE VAR Controller Type 2 which is a summing point type controller. It makes up the outside loop of a two-loop system. This controller is implemented as a slow PI type controller, and the voltage regulator forms the inner loop and is implemented as a fast controller.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 11.5.
