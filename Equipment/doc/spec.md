Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The parts of a power system that are physical devices, electronic or mechanical.**  

## List of properties  

- `EquipmentContainer`: Container of this equipment. Default: None  - `OperationalLimitSet`: The operational limit sets associated with this equipment. Default: 'list'  - `address`: The mailing address  - `aggregate`: The single instance of equipment represents multiple pieces of equipment that have been modeled together as an aggregate.  Examples would be power transformers or synchronous machines operating in parallel modeled as a single aggregate power transformer or aggregate synchronous machine.  This is not to be used to indicate equipment that is part of a group of interdependent equipment produced by a network production program. Default: False  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be Equipment    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
