## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `dt`: (Dt). Default: 0.0  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `k`: Fraction of the turbine power developed by turbine sections not involved in fast valving (K). Default: 0.0  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `mwbase`: Alternate Base used instead of Machine base in equipment model if necessary (MWbase) (>0).  Unit = MW. Default: 0.0  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `r`: (R). Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `t1`: Governor time constant (T1). Default: 0  - `t3`: Reheater time constant (T3). Default: 0  - `ta`: Time after initial time for valve to close (Ta). Default: 0  - `tb`: Time after initial time for valve to begin opening (Tb). Default: 0  - `tc`: Time after initial time for valve to become fully open (Tc). Default: 0  - `ti`: Initial time to begin fast valving (Ti). Default: 0  - `tt`: Time constant with which power falls off after intercept valve closure (Tt). Default: 0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be GovSteamFV2  - `vmax`: (Vmax). Default: 0.0  - `vmin`: (Vmin). Default: 0.0
