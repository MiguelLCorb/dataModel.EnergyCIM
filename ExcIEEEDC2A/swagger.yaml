    Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC2A model. This model represents represent field-controlled dc commutator exciters with continuously acting voltage regulators having supplies obtained from the generator or auxiliary bus.  It differs from the Type DC1A model only in the voltage regulator output limits, which are now proportional to terminal voltage . It is representative of solid-state replacements for various forms of older mechanical and rotating amplifier regulating equipment connected to dc commutator exciters.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 5.2.
