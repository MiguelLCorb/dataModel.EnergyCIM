# ControlArea

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. A control areais a grouping of generating units and/or loads and a cutset of tie lines (as terminals) which may be used for a variety of purposes including automatic generation control, powerflow solution area interchange control specification, and input to load forecasting.   Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical model.
