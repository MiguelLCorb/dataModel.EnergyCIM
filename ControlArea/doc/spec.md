Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. A control areais a grouping of generating units and/or loads and a cutset of tie lines (as terminals) which may be used for a variety of purposes including automatic generation control, powerflow solution area interchange control specification, and input to load forecasting.   Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical model.**  

## List of properties  

- `ControlAreaGeneratingUnit`: The generating unit specificaitons for the control area. Default: 'list'  - `EnergyArea`: The energy area that is forecast from this control area specification. Default: None  - `TieFlow`: The tie flows associated with the control area. Default: 'list'  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `netInterchange`: The specified positive net interchange into the control area, i.e. positive sign means flow in to the area. Default: 0.0  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `pTolerance`: Active power net interchange tolerance Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: The primary type of control area definition used to determine if this is used for automatic generation control, for planning interchange control, or other purposes.   A control area specified with primary type of automatic generation control could still be forecast and used as an interchange area in power flow analysis. Default: None    
Required properties  
Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
