# ProprietaryParameterDynamics

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. Supports definition of one or more parameters of several different datatypes for use by proprietary user-defined models.  NOTE: This class does not inherit from IdentifiedObject since it is not intended that a single instance of it be referenced by more than one proprietary user-defined model instance.
