# ExcDC2A

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. Modified IEEE DC2A direct current commutator exciters with speed input, one more leg block in feedback loop and without underexcitation limiters (UEL) inputs.  DC type 2 excitation system model with added speed multiplier, added lead-lag, and voltage-dependent limits.
