## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `efd1`: Exciter voltage at which exciter saturation is defined (Efd1).  Typical Value = 3.05. Default: 0.0  - `efd2`: Exciter voltage at which exciter saturation is defined (Efd2).  Typical Value = 2.29. Default: 0.0  - `exclim`: (exclim).  IEEE standard is ambiguous about lower limit on exciter output. true = a lower limit of zero is applied to integrator output false = a lower limit of zero is not applied to integrator output. Typical Value = true. Default: False  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `ka`: Voltage regulator gain (Ka).  Typical Value = 300. Default: 0.0  - `ke`: Exciter constant related to self-excited field (Ke).  If Ke is entered as zero, the model calculates an effective value of Ke such that the initial condition value of Vr is zero. The zero value of Ke is not changed.  If Ke is entered as non-zero, its value is used directly, without change.  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0  - `kf`: Excitation control system stabilizer gain (Kf).  Typical Value = 0.1. Default: 0.0  - `ks`: Coefficient to allow different usage of the model-speed coefficient (Ks).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `seefd1`: Exciter saturation function value at the corresponding exciter voltage, Efd1 (Se[Eefd1]).  Typical Value = 0.279. Default: 0.0  - `seefd2`: Exciter saturation function value at the corresponding exciter voltage, Efd2 (Se[Efd2]).  Typical Value = 0.117. Default: 0.0  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `ta`: Voltage regulator time constant (Ta).  Typical Value = 0.01. Default: 0  - `tb`: Voltage regulator time constant (Tb).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0  - `tc`: Voltage regulator time constant (Tc).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0  - `te`: Exciter time constant, integration rate associated with exciter control (Te).  Typical Value = 1.33. Default: 0  - `tf`: Excitation control system stabilizer time constant (Tf).  Typical Value = 0.675. Default: 0  - `tf1`: Excitation control system stabilizer time constant (Tf1).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be ExcDC2A  - `vrmax`: Maximum voltage regulator output (Vrmax).  Typical Value = 4.95. Default: 0.0  - `vrmin`: Minimum voltage regulator output (Vrmin).  Typical Value = -4.9. Default: 0.0  - `vtlim`: (Vtlim). true = limiter at the block [Ka/(1+sTa)] is dependent on Vt  false = limiter at the block is not dependent on Vt. Typical Value = true. Default: False
