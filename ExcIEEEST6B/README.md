# ExcIEEEST6B

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST6B model. This model consists of a PI voltage regulator with an inner loop field voltage regulator and pre-control. The field voltage regulator implements a proportional control. The pre-control and the delay in the feedback circuit increase the dynamic response.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 7.6.
