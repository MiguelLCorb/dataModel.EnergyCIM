# DiscExcContIEEEDEC1A

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Type DEC1A discontinuous excitation control model that boosts generator excitation to a level higher than that demanded by the voltage regulator and stabilizer immediately following a system fault.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 12.2.
