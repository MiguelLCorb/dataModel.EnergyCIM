## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `at`: Ambient temperature load limit (Load Limit).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `dturb`: Turbine damping factor (Dturb).  Typical Value = 0.18. Default: 0.0  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `kt`: Temperature limiter gain (Kt).  Typical Value = 3. Default: 0.0  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `mwbase`: Base for power values (MWbase) (> 0). Default: 0.0  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `r`: Permanent droop (R).  Typical Value = 0.04. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `t1`: Governor mechanism time constant (T1).  T1 represents the natural valve positioning time constant of the governor for small disturbances, as seen when rate limiting is not in effect.  Typical Value = 0.5. Default: 0  - `t2`: Turbine power time constant (T2).  T2 represents delay due to internal energy storage of the gas turbine engine. T2 can be used to give a rough approximation to the delay associated with acceleration of the compressor spool of a multi-shaft engine, or with the compressibility of gas in the plenum of a the free power turbine of an aero-derivative unit, for example.  Typical Value = 0.5. Default: 0  - `t3`: Turbine exhaust temperature time constant (T3).  Typical Value = 3. Default: 0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be GovGAST  - `vmax`: Maximum turbine power, PU of MWbase (Vmax).  Typical Value = 1. Default: 0.0  - `vmin`: Minimum turbine power, PU of MWbase (Vmin).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0
