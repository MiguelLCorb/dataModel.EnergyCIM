# ValueAliasSet

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. Describes the translation of a set of values into a name and is intendend to facilitate cusom translations. Each ValueAliasSet has a name, description etc. A specific Measurement may represent a discrete state like Open, Closed, Intermediate etc. This requires a translation from the MeasurementValue.value number to a string, e.g. 0->'Invalid', 1->'Open', 2->'Closed', 3->'Intermediate'. Each ValueToAlias member in ValueAliasSet.Value describe a mapping for one particular value to a name.
