# ExcIEEEAC6A

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC6A model. The model represents field-controlled alternator-rectifier excitation systems with system-supplied electronic voltage regulators.  The maximum output of the regulator, , is a function of terminal voltage, . The field current limiter included in the original model AC6A remains in the 2005 update.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.6.
