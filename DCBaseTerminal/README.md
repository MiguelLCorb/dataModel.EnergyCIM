# DCBaseTerminal

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. An electrical connection point at a piece of DC conducting equipment. DC terminals are connected at one physical DC node that may have multiple DC terminals connected. A DC node is similar to an AC connectivity node. The model enforces that DC connections are distinct from AC connections.
