# LoadGenericNonLinear

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. These load models (known also as generic non-linear dynamic (GNLD) load models) can be used in mid-term and long-term voltage stability simulations (i.e., to study voltage collapse), as they can replace a more detailed representation of aggregate load, including induction motors, thermostatically controlled and static loads.
