===================

Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST4B model. This model is a variation of the Type ST3A model, with a proportional plus integral (PI) regulator block replacing the lag-lead regulator characteristic that is in the ST3A model. Both potential and compound source rectifier excitation systems are modeled.  The PI regulator blocks have non-windup limits that are represented. The voltage regulator of this model is typically implemented digitally.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 7.4.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `kc`: Rectifier loading factor proportional to commutating reactance (K). Typical Value = 0.113. Default: 0.0  - `kg`: Feedback gain constant of the inner loop field regulator (K).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  - `ki`: Potential circuit gain coefficient (K).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  - `kim`: Voltage regulator integral gain output (K).  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  - `kir`: Voltage regulator integral gain (K).  Typical Value = 10.75.

Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
