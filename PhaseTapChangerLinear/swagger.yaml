    Adapted from CIM data models. Describes a tap changer with a linear relation between the tap step and the phase angle difference across the transformer. This is a mathematical model that is an approximation of a real phase tap changer. The phase angle is computed as stepPhaseShitfIncrement times the tap position. The secondary side voltage magnitude is the same as at the primary side.
