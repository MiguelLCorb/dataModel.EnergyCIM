Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow). A power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical. A power transformer can be modeled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals. The inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.**  

## List of properties  

- `PowerTransformerEnd`: The power transformer of this power transformer end. Default: 'list'  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `beforeShCircuitHighestOperatingCurrent`: The highest operating current (Ib in the IEC 60909-0) before short circuit (depends on network configuration and relevant reliability philosophy). It is used for calculation of the impedance correction factor KT defined in IEC 60909-0. Default: 0.0  - `beforeShCircuitHighestOperatingVoltage`: The highest operating voltage (Ub in the IEC 60909-0) before short circuit. It is used for calculation of the impedance correction factor KT defined in IEC 60909-0. This is worst case voltage on the low side winding (Section 3.7.1 in the standard). Used to define operating conditions. Default: 0.0  - `beforeShortCircuitAnglePf`: The angle of power factor before short circuit (phib in the IEC 60909-0). It is used for calculation of the impedance correction factor KT defined in IEC 60909-0. This is the worst case power factor. Used to define operating conditions. Default: 0.0  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `highSideMinOperatingU`: The minimum operating voltage (uQmin in the IEC 60909-0) at the high voltage side (Q side) of the unit transformer of the power station unit. A value well established from long-term operating experience of the system. It is used for calculation of the impedance correction factor KG defined in IEC 60909-0 Default: 0.0  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `isPartOfGeneratorUnit`: Indicates whether the machine is part of a power station unit. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909 Default: False  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `operationalValuesConsidered`: It is used to define if the data (other attributes related to short circuit data exchange) defines long term operational conditions or not. Used for short circuit data exchange according to IEC 60909. Default: False  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be PowerTransformer    
Required properties  
Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
