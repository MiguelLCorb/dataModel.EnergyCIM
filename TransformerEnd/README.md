# TransformerEnd

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. A conducting connection point of a power transformer. It corresponds to a physical transformer winding terminal.  In earlier CIM versions, the TransformerWinding class served a similar purpose, but this class is more flexible because it associates to terminal but is not a specialization of ConductingEquipment.
