Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. This class represents the zero sequence line mutual coupling.**  

## List of properties  

- `First_Terminal`: The starting terminal for the calculation of distances along the first branch of the mutual coupling.  Normally MutualCoupling would only be used for terminals of AC line segments.  The first and second terminals of a mutual coupling should point to different AC line segments. Default: None  - `Second_Terminal`: The starting terminal for the calculation of distances along the second branch of the mutual coupling. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `b0ch`: Zero sequence mutual coupling shunt (charging) susceptance, uniformly distributed, of the entire line section. Default: 0.0  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `distance11`: Distance to the start of the coupled region from the first line`s terminal having sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0  - `distance12`: Distance to the end of the coupled region from the first line`s terminal with sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0  - `distance21`: Distance to the start of coupled region from the second line`s terminal with sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0  - `distance22`: Distance to the end of coupled region from the second line`s terminal with sequence number equal to 1. Default: 0.0  - `g0ch`: Zero sequence mutual coupling shunt (charging) conductance, uniformly distributed, of the entire line section. Default: 0.0  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `r0`: Zero sequence branch-to-branch mutual impedance coupling, resistance. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be MutualCoupling  - `x0`: Zero sequence branch-to-branch mutual impedance coupling, reactance. Default: 0.0
