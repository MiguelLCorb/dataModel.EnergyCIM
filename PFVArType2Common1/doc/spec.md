=========================  
[Open License](https://github.com/smart-data-models//dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/PFVArType2Common1/LICENSE.md)  
Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. Power factor / Reactive power regulator. This model represents the power factor or reactive power controller such as the Basler SCP-250. The controller measures power factor or reactive power (PU on generator rated power) and compares it with the operator's set point.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `j`: Selector (J). true = control mode for reactive power false = control mode for power factor. Default: False  - `ki`: Reset gain (Ki). Default: 0.0  - `kp`: Proportional gain (Kp). Default: 0.0  - `location`:   - `max`: Output limit (max). Default: 0.0  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `ref`: Reference value of reactive power or power factor (Ref). The reference value is initialised by this model. This initialisation may override the value exchanged by this attribute to represent a plant operator`s change of the reference setting. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be PFVArType2Common1    
Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
