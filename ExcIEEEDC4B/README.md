# ExcIEEEDC4B

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC4B model. These excitation systems utilize a field-controlled dc commutator exciter with a continuously acting voltage regulator having supplies obtained from the generator or auxiliary bus.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 5.4.
