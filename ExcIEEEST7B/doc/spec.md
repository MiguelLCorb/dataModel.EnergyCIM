Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type ST7B model. This model is representative of static potential-source excitation systems. In this system, the AVR consists of a PI voltage regulator. A phase lead-lag filter in series allows introduction of a derivative function, typically used with brushless excitation systems. In that case, the regulator is of the PID type. In addition, the terminal voltage channel includes a phase lead-lag filter.  The AVR includes the appropriate inputs on its reference for overexcitation limiter (OEL1), underexcitation limiter (UEL), stator current limiter (SCL), and current compensator (DROOP). All these limitations, when they work at voltage reference level, keep the PSS (VS signal from Type PSS1A, PSS2A, or PSS2B) in operation. However, the UEL limitation can also be transferred to the high value (HV) gate acting on the output signal. In addition, the output signal passes through a low value (LV) gate for a ceiling overexcitation limiter (OEL2).  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 7.7.**

Required properties  
Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
