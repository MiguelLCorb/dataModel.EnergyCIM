## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `ControlAreaGeneratingUnit[number]`: ControlArea specifications for this generating unit. Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `GrossToNetActivePowerCurves[number]`: A generating unit may have a gross active power to net active power curve, describing the losses and auxiliary power requirements of the unit. Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `RotatingMachine[number]`: A synchronous machine may operate as a generator and as such becomes a member of a generating unit. Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp.

Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `startupCost[number]`: The initial startup cost incurred for each start of the GeneratingUnit. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `totalEfficiency[number]`: The efficiency of the unit in converting the fuel into electrical energy. Default: 0.0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `type[string]`: NGSI type. It has to be GeneratingUnit  - `variableCost[number]`: The variable cost component of production per unit of ActivePower. Default: 0.0  .
