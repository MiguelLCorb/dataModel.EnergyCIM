## List of properties  

<sup><sub>[*] If there is not a type in an attribute is because it could have several types or different formats/patterns</sub></sup>  
- `BusNameMarker[number]`: The bus name marker used to name the bus (topological node). Default: None  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `Measurements[number]`: Measurements associated with this terminal defining  where the measurement is placed in the network topology.  It may be used, for instance, to capture the sensor position, such as a voltage transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `OperationalLimitSet[number]`:  Default: 'list'  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `address[object]`: The mailing address  . Model: [https://schema.org/address](https://schema.org/address)- `alternateName[string]`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed[string]`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  . Model: [https://schema.org/Text](https://schema.org/Text)- `connected[number]`: The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.  True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.  In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment, where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case. Default: False  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `dataProvider[string]`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated[string]`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified[string]`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description[string]`: A description of this item  - `id[*]`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location[*]`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name[string]`: The name of this item.  - `owner[array]`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso[*]`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `sequenceNumber[number]`: The orientation of the terminal connections for a multiple terminal conducting equipment.  The sequence numbering starts with 1 and additional terminals should follow in increasing order.   The first terminal is the `starting point` for a two terminal branch. Default: 0  . Model: [https://schema.org/Number](https://schema.org/Number)- `source[string]`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type[string]`: NGSI type. It has to be ACDCTerminal  <!-- /30-PropertiesList -->
