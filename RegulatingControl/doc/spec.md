Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. Specifies a set of equipment that works together to control a power system quantity such as voltage or flow.  Remote bus voltage control is possible by specifying the controlled terminal located at some place remote from the controlling equipment. In case multiple equipment, possibly of different types, control same terminal there must be only one RegulatingControl at that terminal. The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers. For flow control  load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.**  

## List of properties  

- `RegulatingCondEq`: The equipment that participates in this regulating control scheme. Default: 'list'  - `RegulationSchedule`: Schedule for this Regulating regulating control. Default: 'list'  - `Terminal`: The controls regulating this terminal. Default: None  - `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `discrete`: The regulation is performed in a discrete mode. This applies to equipment with discrete controls, e.g. tap changers and shunt compensators. Default: False  - `enabled`: The flag tells if regulation is enabled. Default: False  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `mode`: The regulating control mode presently available.  This specification allows for determining the kind of regulation without need for obtaining the units from a schedule. Default: None  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `targetDeadband`: This is a deadband used with discrete control to avoid excessive update of controls like tap changers and shunt compensator banks while regulating. The units of those appropriate for the mode. Default: 0.0  - `targetValue`: The target value specified for case input.   This value can be used for the target value without the use of schedules. The value has the units appropriate to the mode attribute. Default: 0.0  - `targetValueUnitMultiplier`: Specify the multiplier for used for the targetValue. Default: None  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be RegulatingControl
