# PssIEEE3B

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type PSS3B power system stabilizer model. The PSS model PSS3B has dual inputs of electrical power and rotor angular frequency deviation. The signals are used to derive an equivalent mechanical power signal.  Reference: IEEE 3B 421.5-2005 Section 8.3.
