# DCTopologicalIsland

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. An electrically connected subset of the network. DC topological islands can change as the current network state changes: e.g. due to  - disconnect switches or breakers change state in a SCADA/EMS - manual creation, change or deletion of topological nodes in a planning tool.
