    "description": "Adapted from CIM data models. A conductor, or group of conductors, with negligible impedance, that serve to connect other conducting equipment within a single substation.  Voltage measurements are typically obtained from VoltageTransformers that are connected to busbar sections. A bus bar section may have many physical terminals but for analysis is modelled with exactly one logical terminal.",
