## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `damping`: Damping torque coefficient (D).  A proportionality constant that, when multiplied by the angular velocity of the rotor poles with respect to the magnetic field (frequency), results in the damping torque.  This value is often zero when the sources of damping torques (generator damper windings, load damping effects, etc.) are modelled in detail.  Typical Value = 0. Default: 0.0  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `inertia`: Inertia constant of generator or motor and mechanical load (H) (>0).  This is the specification for the stored energy in the rotating mass when operating at rated speed.  For a generator, this includes the generator plus all other elements (turbine, exciter) on the same shaft and has units of MW*sec.  For a motor, it includes the motor plus its mechanical load. Conventional units are per unit on the generator MVA base, usually expressed as MW*second/MVA or just second.   This value is used in the accelerating power reference frame for operator training simulator solutions.  Typical Value = 3. Default: 0  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `saturationFactor`: Saturation factor at rated terminal voltage (S1) (> or =0).  Not used by simplified model.  Defined by defined by S(E1) in the SynchronousMachineSaturationParameters diagram.  Typical Value = 0.02. Default: 0.0  - `saturationFactor120`: Saturation factor at 120% of rated terminal voltage (S12) (> or =S1). Not used by the simplified model, defined by S(E2) in the SynchronousMachineSaturationParameters diagram.  Typical Value = 0.12. Default: 0.0  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `statorLeakageReactance`: Stator leakage reactance (Xl) (> or =0). Typical Value = 0.15. Default: 0.0  - `statorResistance`: Stator (armature) resistance (Rs) (> or =0). Typical Value = 0.005. Default: 0.0  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be RotatingMachineDynamics

Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
