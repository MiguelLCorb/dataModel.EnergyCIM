Entity: ExcIEEEAC2A  
===================  
[Open License](https://github.com/smart-data-models//dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/ExcIEEEAC2A/LICENSE.md)  
Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC2A model. The model represents a high initial response field-controlled alternator-rectifier excitation system. The alternator main exciter is used with non-controlled rectifiers. The Type AC2A model is similar to that of Type AC1A except for the inclusion of exciter time constant compensation and exciter field current limiting elements.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.2.**

Required properties  
This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, pelase raise an issue or send mail to alberto.abella@fiware.org
