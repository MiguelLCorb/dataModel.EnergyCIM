# ExcIEEEAC2A

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC2A model. The model represents a high initial response field-controlled alternator-rectifier excitation system. The alternator main exciter is used with non-controlled rectifiers. The Type AC2A model is similar to that of Type AC1A except for the inclusion of exciter time constant compensation and exciter field current limiting elements.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.2.
