# ExcIEEEAC4A

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type AC4A model. The model represents type AC4A alternator-supplied controlled-rectifier excitation system which is quite different from the other type ac systems. This high initial response excitation system utilizes a full thyristor bridge in the exciter output circuit.  The voltage regulator controls the firing of the thyristor bridges. The exciter alternator uses an independent voltage regulator to control its output voltage to a constant value. These effects are not modeled; however, transient loading effects on the exciter alternator are included.   Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 6.4.
