# PssIEEE2B

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type PSS2B power system stabilizer model. This stabilizer model is designed to represent a variety of dual-input stabilizers, which normally use combinations of power and speed or frequency to derive the stabilizing signal.  Reference: IEEE 2B 421.5-2005 Section 8.2.
