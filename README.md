- [LoadDynamics](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadDynamics/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. Load whose behaviour is described by reference to a standard model   A standard feature of dynamic load behaviour modelling is the ability to associate the same behaviour to multiple energy consumers by means of a single aggregate load definition.  Aggregate loads are used to represent all or part of the real and reactive load from one or more loads in the static (power flow) data. This load is usually the aggregation of many individual load devices and the load model is approximate representation of the aggregate response of the load devices to system disturbances. The load model is always applied to individual bus loads (energy consumers) but a single set of load model parameters can used for all loads in the grouping.

- [LoadGenericNonLinear](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadGenericNonLinear/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. These load models (known also as generic non-linear dynamic (GNLD) load models) can be used in mid-term and long-term voltage stability simulations (i.e., to study voltage collapse), as they can replace a more detailed representation of aggregate load, including induction motors, thermostatically controlled and static loads.

- [LoadGroup](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadGroup/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. The class is the third level in a hierarchical structure for grouping of loads for the purpose of load flow load scaling.

- [LoadMotor](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadMotor/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. Aggregate induction motor load. This model  is used to represent a fraction of an ordinary load as induction motor load.  It allows load that is treated as ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be represented by an induction motor in dynamic simulation.  If  = 0. or  = , or  = 0.,  only one cage is represented. Magnetic saturation is not modelled. Either a 'one-cage' or 'two-cage' model of the induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled.  This model is intended for representation of aggregations of many motors dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is no information on the characteristics of individual motors.  This model treats a fraction of the constant power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation, the initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to  times the constant  part of the static load.  The remainder of the load is left as static load.  The reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation as a function of voltage at the load bus. This reactive power demand may be less than or greater than the constant  component of the load.  If the motor's reactive demand is greater than the constant  component of the load, the model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant  reactive load.   If a motor model and a static load model are both present for a load, the motor  is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant  load before the static load model is applied.  The remainder of the load, if any, is then represented by the static load model.

- [LoadResponseCharacteristic](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadResponseCharacteristic/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. Models the characteristic response of the load demand due to changes in system conditions such as voltage and frequency. This is not related to demand response.  If LoadResponseCharacteristic.exponentModel is True, the voltage exponents are specified and used as to calculate:  Active power component = Pnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage) ** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.pVoltageExponent  Reactive power component = Qnominal * (Voltage/cim:BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage)** cim:LoadResponseCharacteristic.qVoltageExponent  Where  * means 'multiply' and ** is 'raised to power of'.

- [LoadStatic](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/LoadStatic/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. General static load model representing the sensitivity of the real and reactive power consumed by the load to the amplitude and frequency of the bus voltage.

- [Measurement](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.EnergyCIM/blob/master/Measurement/README.md). Adapted from CIM data models. A Measurement represents any measured, calculated or non-measured non-calculated quantity. Any piece of equipment may contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch status measurement.  The PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leafs, e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement. Some Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment.  If both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance. When the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal association is never used alone.
