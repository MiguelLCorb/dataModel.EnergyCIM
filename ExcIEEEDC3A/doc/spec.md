Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type DC3A model. This model represents represent older systems, in particular those dc commutator exciters with non-continuously acting regulators that were commonly used before the development of the continuously acting varieties.  These systems respond at basically two different rates, depending upon the magnitude of voltage error. For small errors, adjustment is made periodically with a signal to a motor-operated rheostat. Larger errors cause resistors to be quickly shorted or inserted and a strong forcing signal applied to the exciter. Continuous motion of the motor-operated rheostat occurs for these larger error signals, even though it is bypassed by contactor action.   Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 5.3.**
