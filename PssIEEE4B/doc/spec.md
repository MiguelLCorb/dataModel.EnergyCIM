Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Std 421.5-2005 type PSS2B power system stabilizer model. The PSS4B model represents a structure based on multiple working frequency bands. Three separate bands, respectively dedicated to the low-, intermediate- and high-frequency modes of oscillations, are used in this delta-omega (speed input) PSS.

Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
