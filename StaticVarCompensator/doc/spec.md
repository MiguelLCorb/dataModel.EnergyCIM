Global description: **Adapted from CIM data models. A facility for providing variable and controllable shunt reactive power. The SVC typically consists of a stepdown transformer, filter, thyristor-controlled reactor, and thyristor-switched capacitor arms.  The SVC may operate in fixed MVar output mode or in voltage control mode. When in voltage control mode, the output of the SVC will be proportional to the deviation of voltage at the controlled bus from the voltage setpoint.  The SVC characteristic slope defines the proportion.  If the voltage at the controlled bus is equal to the voltage setpoint, the SVC MVar output is zero.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `capacitiveRating`: Maximum available capacitive reactance. Default: 0.0  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `inductiveRating`: Maximum available inductive reactance. Default: 0.0  - `location`:   - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `q`: Reactive power injection. Load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a node. Starting value for a steady state solution. Default: 0.0  - `sVCControlMode`: SVC control mode. Default: None  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `slope`: The characteristics slope of an SVC defines how the reactive power output changes in proportion to the difference between the regulated bus voltage and the voltage setpoint. Default: 0.0  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI type. It has to be StaticVarCompensator  - `voltageSetPoint`: The reactive power output of the SVC is proportional to the difference between the voltage at the regulated bus and the voltage setpoint.  When the regulated bus voltage is equal to the voltage setpoint, the reactive power output is zero. Default: 0.0    
Required properties  
Adapted from CIM data models and CIMpy - [https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy](https://github.com/sogno-platform/cimpy). This data model is a direct conversion of the Common Information Model (CIM) specified by the IEC61970 standard into smart data models. The python classes this model is based on were developed by these entities Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems (ACS), EON Energy Research Center (EONERC) and RWTH University Aachen, Germany. Some properties can have wrong type. This was the case, please raise an issue or send mail to info@smartdatamodels.org.
