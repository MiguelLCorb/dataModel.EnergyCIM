# DiscExcContIEEEDEC3A

## Description 

Adapted from CIM data models. The class represents IEEE Type DEC3A model. In some systems, the stabilizer output is disconnected from the regulator immediately following a severe fault to prevent the stabilizer from competing with action of voltage regulator during the first swing.  Reference: IEEE Standard 421.5-2005 Section 12.4.
